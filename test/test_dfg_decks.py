"""Every-deck sweep for the dfg tool.

Discovers every display deck in a test tree and runs on each.

  * No deck may crash: every deck either generates or throws
    dfg.model.Error
  * Every PADR type-resolves against the SDF library (no NAME BIT(16)
    fallback): the compool resolver reads ONLY the compiler's PASS3 SDFs,
    and with the build's SDFLIB present every referent must be found there.

DFG_SDFLIB points the resolver at a different SDF library (default: the
OI340600 build's gen/SDFLIB).
