#
# The Dynamic Data Table (DDT) — sequencing and resolution.
#
# The DDT is a bytecode of opcodes evaluated every display cycle (by DCI#FMT,
# one CASE per opcode) to draw the live fields — each dynamic directive
# (`VPARM`, `RTC`, `TEST`, `CHARR`, …) becomes an opcode plus one or more PADR
# pointers to the compool variables it reads.
#
# The section is built from `ops.DDTOp` objects — one per deck directive, each
# translating itself into words + comments (see `ops`); this module sequences
# them (`build_ddt`) and runs the passes that need the whole section:
# branch/type-length resolution (`_resolve_flow`) and the rate-group draw
# budgets (`resolve_rate_count`).  Several constants in this module are
# measured values whose generator rule is unknown; each says so where it is
# defined.

# The rate-count word (word 1 of a RATE entry) is the group's worst-case FCW
# draw.  The runtime (MLIB80/DCI#FMT CASE 21) uses it only as a reservation:
# a buffer-fit check and the next group's DEU fill address, both `count + 10`.
# So any count >= the true draw is functionally safe (an under-count corrupts
# the display; an over-count only wastes DEU memory) — but the original DFG's
# budgets sometimes EXCEED the runtime draw, and reproducing its output
# word-for-word means reproducing those budgets.  Each such allowance below
# is marked; the base draws match the runtime code.  `_rate_count` walks the
# group's control flow taking the longest valid path; every directive in a
# group must have a modeled draw, or the group refuses via `Error` (never a
# wrong value).
#
# Fixed per-directive draw budgets.  VCORDR budgets 6 FCWs per segment and
# CIRCR 3, independent of the runtime geometry.  COLORR/TRANSXR/TRANSYR/LSITE
# are the DCI#FMT CASE output-buffer counts: COLORR (CASE 26) stores 1 FCW3';
# TRANSXR/TRANSYR (6/7) store the translate FCW + FCW2 = 2; LSITE (25) stores
# 4.  FCWSR (array-element pointer expanding one formatted directory line)
# budgets a fixed 25 char-pairs (a full line width), not content-dependent.
# HEX (subbit setup for the following VPARM) emits NOTHING at runtime — CASE
# 24 just stores length/shift into CLOCLGTH/CLOCSHFT and advances the DDT
# pointer; the hex VPARM's own draw carries the chars.
